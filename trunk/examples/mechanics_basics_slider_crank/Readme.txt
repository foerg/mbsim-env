This example shows a planar slider-crank mechanism. The setting is according to

P. Flores, R. Leine, C. Glocker : Modeling and analysis of planar rigid multibody systems with translational clearance joints based on the non-smooth dynamics approach

We would like to compare D1MinusLinear timestepping in MBSim with the one implemented in SICONOS.
