This example shows a planar slider-crank mechanism. The setting is according to

P. Flores, R. Leine, C. Glocker : Modeling and analysis of planar rigid multibody systems with translational clearance joints based on the non-smooth dynamics approach

T. Schindler, S. Rezaei, J. Kursawe, V. Acary : Half-explicit timestepping schemes on velocity level based on time-discontinuous Galerkin methods

We would like to compare HETS2Timestepping in MBSim.
