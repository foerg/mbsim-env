This example shows a planar slider-crank mechanism. The setting is according to

We would like to compare D1MinusLinear timestepping in MBSim with the one implemented in SICONOS. However even for TimeSteppingIntegrator our results are too strongly damped in comparison with SICONOS and the paper results -> what's going on; I hope that the problem is sitting in front of the computer in Grenoble...
