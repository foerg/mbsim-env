How to install external Nurbs++ Library for MBSim

1. Download: (in MBSim/thirdparty or originally at http://sourceforge.net/projects/libnurbs/)

2. Patchen
- change to ../MBSim/thirdparty/nurbs/nurbs++-3.0.11
- use patch ("patch -p1 < ../nurbs++-3.0.11.1.patch")
- use patch ("patch -p1 < ../nurbs++-3.0.11.2.patch")

3. Installation
- configure project in ../MBSim/thirdparty/nurbs/nurbs++-3.0.11/ ("./configure --prefix=../MBSim/Install")
- compile and install project ("make install")

4. Possible Nurbs++ improvements
- virtual destructor
- plib_config.h <-> plib.h
- Nurbs++ seems not to work with cppunit 1.12 -> workaround: has_cppunit="no" in line 8273 of configure

5. Compile using MinGW
- configure with: ./configure ... CPPFLAGS="-fpermissive"
