This example shows a spatial beam with large deflections with joint and contact.

Validation of FlexibleBody1s33ANCF. Please consider that this is flexible body is based on a cable element, which does not explicitly represent rotation about the beam axis. Clamping restricting this motion or contact forcing such a motion is not possible or will be projected.
